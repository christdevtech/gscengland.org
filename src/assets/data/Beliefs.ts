      "We believe man is fallen from righteousness and, apart from the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, is destitute of holiness and inclined to evil. Except a man be born again, he cannot enter the Kingdom of God (John 3:5 KJV). In his own strength, without divine grace, man cannot do good works pleasing and acceptable to God.

We believe the order of public worship should be the same in all places.
